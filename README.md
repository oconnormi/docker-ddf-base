## Requirements

Any upstream containers must provide environment variables for:

* APP_NAME - Name of application, used for branding by the entrypoint
* APP_HOME - Home Directory for application installation (should have a bin directory as a child)
* APP_LOG - Location of the application log file

## Usage

This image is meant to be the basis for any ddf based image and cannot be run on its own.
It packages the dependencies and an entrypoint script for use with any ddf based application

```Dockerfile
FROM oconnormi/ddf-base

ENV APP_NAME=<app_name>
ENV APP_HOME=<app_home>
ENV APP_LOG=<log_file>
...
# Install application
```
